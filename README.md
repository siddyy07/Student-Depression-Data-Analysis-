## Introduction

Understanding mental health challenges and academic performance trends among students is crucial for implementing effective interventions. This project employs SQL to query and process data, with Tableau used for creating interactive visualizations to uncover insights.

---

## Dataset Description

### **1. SQL Dataset** (`Student.sql`)
- SQL script containing structured queries to analyze:
  - Academic pressure
  - Financial stress
  - Sleep patterns
  - Depression prevalence
- Enables filtering, aggregation, and joining of student-related data.

### **2. Tableau Workbook** (`Project 1.twb`)
- Tableau workbook containing interactive dashboards and visualizations:
  - Gender-wise depression rates.
  - Relationship between sleep duration and academic performance.
  - Financial stress trends across different demographic groups.

---

## Analysis Goals

1. Use SQL queries to extract and transform data for analysis.
2. Visualize insights using Tableau dashboards:
   - Depression rates by demographic factors.
   - Academic pressure vs. study habits.
   - Financial stress patterns.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Database**: MySQL
  - Queries written in `Student.sql` to extract meaningful insights.
- **Visualization Tool**: Tableau
  - Interactive dashboards and charts created using `Project 1.twb`.

---

## Key Insights

1. **Academic Pressure**: Higher academic pressure correlates with reduced study satisfaction.
2. **Financial Stress**: Students with higher financial stress often report lower performance and higher depression rates.
3. **Sleep Patterns**: Irregular sleep significantly impacts mental health, with an optimal range around 6-8 hours.
4. **Demographic Trends**: Gender and family history of mental illness influence mental health outcomes.
